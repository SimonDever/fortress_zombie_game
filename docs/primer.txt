Creating the SQL Database:
==========================

Set up for the database tables can be found in utils

Use squares.dat for the map
users.dat for the user table
chars.dat for the character table

Create DB user and permissions -- e.g

create user 'urbandead'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'purplecat';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on ud2.* to 'urbandead'@'localhost';

Edit relevant user names and passwords in /localfiles/config.inc.php.sample and copy to config.inc.php

You may also want to edit paths in www/config/MySQL.php

Want to create your own suburb?
===============================

You can use building_generator.pl to generate buildings in roughly the same proportions as they appear in the original Urban Dead.


Apache set up
==============
sudo apachectl start;

(If necessary uncomment php5_module in /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf and 

cd /private/etc
sudo cp php.ini.default php.ini

/etc/apache2/users/louiseadennis.conf  Change permissions on first two lines to all

Set up websharing.
