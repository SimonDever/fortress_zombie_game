Creating the SQL Database:
==========================

Use initial_db.dat in utils

create user 'urbandead'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'purplecat';
GRANT SELECT on squares TO 'urbandead'@'localhost';

Edit relevant user names and passwords in /localfiles/config.inc.php

Want to create your own suburb?
===============================

You can use building_generator.pl to generate buildings in roughly the same proportions as they appear in the original Urban Dead.


Apache set up
==============
sudo apachectl start;

(If necessary uncomment php5_module in /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf and 

cd /private/etc
sudo cp php.ini.default php.ini

/etc/apache2/users/louiseadennis.conf  Change permissions on first two lines to all

Set up websharing.
